LiteChatGPT Icons
=================

To generate the required extension icons:

1. Open icon-generator.html in your web browser
2. Click the download buttons to save each icon size:
   - icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
   - icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
   - icon128.png (128x128 pixels)
3. Save all three PNG files in this icons/ folder

These icons are required for the Chrome extension to load properly.

Alternative: You can create your own custom icons using any image editor,
just make sure they are PNG format and the correct sizes.
